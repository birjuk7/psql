###join###  key element allow us to retrive data from multiple tables at once
#intersection is the elements common to both sets
sql inner join is akin to set intersection
#inner join selects rows from table1 and table2 where they match the selecting column
select * from customers left join purchases on customers.id = purchases.customer_id;
 select * from customers inner join purchases on customers.id = purchases.customer_id limit 3;
select customers.first_name,customers.last_name,purchases.id from customers join purchases on customers.id = purchases.customer_id limit 2;


group by to remove duplicate data

udemy=# select * from customers group by customers.id ;
select customers.first_name,customers.last_name,count(purchases.id) from customers join purchases on customers.id = purchases.customer_id group by customers.id;
